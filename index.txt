782. Avoid "suspected robbery"

Small towns are distributed along the street (which can be understood as all on the number axis), with N banks (the location is represented by the coordinates of the number axis, and the amount represents the amount that can be robbed).

The two kidnappers tried to rob a bank each, and in order to get the police to travel more, they agreed to choose two banks not less than apart D.

Excuse me, what is the maximum total amount they can grab if they meet the agreement.

Input format
Input contains N + 1 lines.

The first line contains two integers N and D, indicating the number of banks and the agreed distance respectively.

Next N lines, each containing two integers A and B, indicating the coordinates and the amount respectively.

Output format
Output a number indicating the maximum amount that can be obtained.

Data scope
1 ≤ N ≤ 2 × 10^5
1 ≤ D, A, B ≤ 10^8

The data guarantee that at least two banks are present at a distance of not less than D.
